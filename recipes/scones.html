    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yummy when fresh from the oven and served with raspberry jam and clotted cream!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g self raising flour</li>
        <li>50g butter (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>25g caster sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>60g black treacle</li>
        <li>125mls milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200degC. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and using your
            fingers, rub the butter into the flour until evenly distributed and the mix looks like fine breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the spices and baking powder. Mix the black treacle and milk together in a measuring jug.</li>
        <li>Pour most of the milk & treacle mixture into the dry mix and stir through - add the rest of the liquid if
            required. You want a nice soft dough but not too wet or sticky. Leave the dough to rest for a few minutes at
            this
            stage to absorb the liquid thoroughly, this will make it a lot easier to handle.</li>
        <li>Flour your work surface well, then tip out the rested dough. Flour your hands before gently shaping the
            dough into
            an even round - using a floured rolling pin roll out the dough to a 2-3cm thickness.</li>
        <li>Cut into small fluted rounds and place on a baking tray. Gather up the dough scraps and roll & cut into more
            rounds - continue until all the doughis used.</li>
        <li>Bake in the pre-heated oven for 10-12 minutes or until well risen and dark golden brown.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool covered with a clean tea towel.</li>
